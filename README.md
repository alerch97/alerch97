- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex!
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development  (Webapps, GUIs) and applications of Machine Learning.
- 🐍 Python is my progamming language of choice. But I'm planning also to get more into others like C#.
- 📫 How to reach me: contact me on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/alerch97

With my enthusiasm for programming, I am determined to start my career in software development. I have 1.5 years of experience in R&D of machine learning models / AI with Python including data preparation. Highlights include the successful development of an AI-based manufacturability check of virtual products and a predictive maintenance AI including an ETL process of time series data.

In private projects and further education courses, I am gaining knowledge in the development of web applications and desktop GUIs and how to bring them to production.
