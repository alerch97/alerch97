With my enthusiasm for programming, I am determined to start my career as a Data Talent. I have 1.5 years of experience in R&D of machine learning models / AI with Python including data preparation. Highlights include the successful development of an AI-based manufacturability check of virtual products and a predictive maintenance AI including an ETL process of time series data.

In private projects and further education courses, I am gaining knowledge in the development of data-driven modells as well as web apps and how to bring them to production.
